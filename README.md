# blackroad-os-ideas

Central idea + experiment backlog for BlackRoad OS. Capture every concept, question, and experiment as an issue.

## How It Works

**New thought → new issue.**

When you have an idea, experiment, or question, create a new issue using one of the templates:
- **Idea**: A new concept or proposal
- **Experiment**: A hypothesis to test or explore
- **Question**: Something you want to understand better

## Labels

Use labels to organize and categorize issues:

### Type Labels
- `type:idea` - New ideas and concepts
- `type:experiment` - Experiments and explorations
- `type:question` - Questions seeking answers

### Domain Labels
- `domain:infra` - Infrastructure and technical architecture
- `domain:brand` - Branding, identity, and positioning
- `domain:theory` - Theoretical foundations and concepts
- *(Add more domain labels as needed)*

## Getting Started

1. Click "New Issue"
2. Choose a template (Idea, Experiment, or Question)
3. Fill in the details
4. Add appropriate labels (type and domain)
5. Submit and discuss!
