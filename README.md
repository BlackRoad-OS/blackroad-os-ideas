# blackroad-os-ideas

blackroad-os-ideas is the structured incubator for every idea powering BlackRoad OS — from small feature sparks to new agent pods and future research directions.

## What Lives Here
- **/ideas/raw** – brain dumps, voice transcripts, screenshots, and unfiltered sparks.
- **/ideas/concepts** – single-page Concept Cards capturing the refined version of a raw idea.
- **/ideas/proposals** – structured specs with goals, risks, and flows.
- **/rfc** – formal cross-repo approval docs when changes touch operator/core/infra/compliance.
- **/roadmap** – quarterly plans reflecting what shipped and what is coming.
- **/templates** – source-of-truth templates for ideas, concepts, agent proposals, and RFCs.
- **/process** – lifecycle rules, prioritization rubric, and convergence path to shipping.
- **/registry** – machine-readable indices of ideas, concepts, and RFCs.
- **/docs** – guidance for contributors and agents on how to propose and ship ideas.

## Idea Pipeline
```
Raw Idea → Concept Card → Proposal → RFC → Operator Implementation → Release
```

## How to Use
1. Capture unfiltered thoughts in `/ideas/raw/` using the idea template.
2. Promote promising threads into Concept Cards under `/ideas/concepts/`.
3. Expand into proposals and RFCs when cross-system change is needed.
4. Track status in the registry JSON files and align roadmap entries with real artifacts.
5. Link out to operator implementations and other repos once work is underway.
