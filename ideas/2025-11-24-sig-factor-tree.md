Prototype a factor tree that maps information density onto a spiral lattice,
treating each branch as a signal amplification step. The goal is to expose
where information decays, how entropy flows between branches, and which
sequences produce stable attractors. Output hooks include a stream-friendly SVG
renderer and a WASM playground for interactive pruning.
