Explore a prime spiral keyed by SHA-256 hashes, turning digest bits into polar
coordinates that animate over time. Each block anchors an ephemeral glyph in
the plane, letting observers watch entropy settle into emergent order. The
experiment measures spectral drift, collision echoes, and whether human
perception spots structure in pseudorandomness faster than statistical tests
do.
