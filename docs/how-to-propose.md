# How to Propose an Idea

Follow this path to move from spark to shipped artifact.

## Steps
1. Start with `/templates/idea-template.md` and capture the raw thought in `/ideas/raw/`.
2. If it has momentum, convert it into a Concept Card using `/templates/concept-card-template.md` under `/ideas/concepts/`.
3. For agent-specific work, draft `/templates/agent-proposal-template.md` and place it in `/ideas/proposals/`.
4. If the change spans repos, schemas, or compliance-sensitive areas, open an RFC using `/templates/rfc-template.md` in `/rfc/`.
5. Score the idea with the prioritization framework and note decisions in the registry JSON files.
6. Link downstream implementation work (issues/PRs) once picked up by `blackroad-os-operator` or sibling repos.
