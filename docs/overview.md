# Overview

blackroad-os-ideas is the idea vortex and incubator for BlackRoad OS. It turns sparks from humans and agents into structured concepts, proposals, RFCs, and ultimately shipped operator features.

## What You Can Do Here
- Capture raw thoughts in `/ideas/raw/` using the idea template.
- Promote strong signals into Concept Cards in `/ideas/concepts/`.
- Author proposals or RFCs when changes span repos or compliance-sensitive surfaces.
- Track decisions and statuses via JSON registries for downstream automation.

## Idea-to-Agent Flow (Example)
1. Raw idea logged in `/ideas/raw/`.
2. Concept Card drafted in `/ideas/concepts/`.
3. Agent Proposal prepared using `/templates/agent-proposal-template.md`.
4. Implementation targets linked to `blackroad-os-operator` and orchestrator wiring.
5. Prism UI updated to expose controls and visibility.
